      value: "<p>Vardoc utilizes the powerful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/book/overview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Book feature</a>&nbsp;to create&nbsp;hierarchical content that flows logically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A&nbsp;<em>book</em>&nbsp;is a set of pages tied together in a hierarchical sequence, perhaps with chapters, sections, subsections, and so on. You can use books for manuals, site resource guides, or whatever you'd like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a visitor to a Vardoc site is viewing a book page, they will automatically see links at the bottom for navigating from the parent-page to the first child page, and from the previous page to the next page. A link labeled Up leads back to the parent page in the book structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the books on a Vardoc site&nbsp;are complex, you may find that you need additional navigational aids beyond the table of contents and the previous/next/up links for users to understand where they are in your book.<br />\r\nThat's where the navigational sidebar will have&nbsp;a menu that shows where the user is in your book; the menu is only visible when viewing the book.</p>\r\n"
